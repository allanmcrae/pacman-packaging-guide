# Your First Package

We will begin walking you through building a simple package.  This will introduce you to a basic software build from source, and then convert that into a package to be installed by the Pacman package manager.

## Hello!

All good programming experiences start with a simple "Hello, world!".  So will your packaging journey.

[GNU Hello](https://www.gnu.org/software/hello/) is an almost-trivial free software program that prints the phrase "Hello, world!" or a translation thereof to the screen. This is primarily to serve as an example of the GNU coding standards, and serve as template for more serious software projects. We shall use it as an introduction to the concept of package software.
